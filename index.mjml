                    As we end our 35th year of helping our neighbors in 
                    Sandy Springs and Dunwoody, CAC continues to make a 
                    measurable impact in the lives of neighbors that 
                    need it the most. From getting families through an 
                    immediate crisis to helping them get back on their own feet, 
                    to going one step further and helping them improve their 
                    financial situation so they can thrive: year after year, 
                    CAC is where we unite to successfully support families 
                    and better our community. Your kindness and concern 
                    for others, expressed through your generous support, 
                    moves the needle for those in need in an impactful, 
                    real way that could not be possible without you.

                    their families. Through a continuously-growing network

                    students with practical, marketable skills. 
                    These courses would normally cost hundreds of 
                    dollars, but are offered free of charge thanks 
                    to donations and volunteers. XXX adults took
